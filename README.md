## Set-up
I grabbed the data from <a href"http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/">earthquake.usgs.gov</a>, sorting by the past year and earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 or higher.

I mapped the longitude and latitude to the magnitudes around the globe. I then exported the image to a map, showing the largest magnitudes around the globe.
